# PedestrianDetection

Computer vision project for detecting and counting pedestrians. We look at five different models.Â 
Three of those are pre-trained models, one is a transfer learning model, and one is implemented from scratch.
We focus on faster R-CNN models and a CenterNet model. Each notebook contains a different model, as indicated by the name of the notebook.
All the models are implemented using Pytorch. We have also included a report in the repository highlighting more details about the project.
